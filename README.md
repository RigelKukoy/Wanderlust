Follow these instructions to set up and run VacationVerse locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended, e.g., v18.x or v20.x)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Replace `yRigelKukoy` with the actual GitHub username or organization if this is a fork.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RigelKukoy/vacationverse.git
    cd vacationverse
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This command will install all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Alternatively, if you prefer using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if provided) or use the template below, replacing the placeholder values with your actual API keys and Supabase credentials.

    ```env
    # .env.local

    # Supabase Configuration
    # You can find these in your Supabase project settings
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-project-url"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-public-anon-key"

    # Foursquare API Configuration
    # You need to register on the Foursquare Developer portal to get an API key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FOURSQUARE_API_KEY="your-foursquare-api-key"
    ```

    - **Important:** Never commit your `.env.local` file or any file containing sensitive credentials to version control. Ensure `.env.local` is listed in your `.gitignore` file.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts the Next.js development server, typically on port 3000.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Alternatively, with Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application running.

## üì¶ APIs Used

VacationVerse leverages several external APIs to provide its core functionalities:

- **Foursquare Places API:** Used to discover places, fetch details about venues (like categories, photos, tips), and find trending spots near the user.
